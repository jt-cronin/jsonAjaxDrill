You should be able to run that and access http://localhost:4567 and see a blank page. And http://localhost:4567/people should show you the JSON you copy/pasted.

Now your task is to write the JavaScript needed to show all of the people from the JSON on the homepage, but you may not edit the HTML at all. Use JavaScript to fetch the people, organize each person into some kind of <div> structure, and insert into the DOM each person's info. Don't worry about styling it--no CSS required.# jsonAjaxDrill
